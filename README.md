To run the code, one would have to run the Project class file. 
The entire program generates an output by receiving an input from an input file called (input.txt)
The user enters a start location ..separated by a comma and a space. Example; Accra, Ghana
The user then enters a destination location, also representted in the same format as the start location .
The user then runs the code as indicated in the first instruction. 
The Project class file contains a variable called input_file which has to be redefined to satisfy the input conditions in the program. Therefore each entry for the input and output variables should be replaced by the input and output directories of the user. 
For the output file directory, the user would have to replace it in the Print Writer object's parameter called output Writer.
